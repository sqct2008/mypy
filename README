Project description: Use scanner and parser to build Abstract Syntax Tree. The program should handle basic python datatype functions.

The easiest part of this project: All the basic requirement in this project.

Problems that I had in completing this project:

I did the best of myself in this project, and really learnt a lot.

Except all the basic requirement in this project, I also finished:

1. Do TILDE, using a trick, which uses "-1 - INT".

2. Do LEFTSHIFT/RIGHTSHIFT, which also using a trick to do.

3. Do STRING, I rewrote the Literal.h, and several classes and make STRING work the right way.
  1) String can be print properly.
  2) String will do ADD properly.
  3) String will do MULT properly.
  *) I did not implement multiassign with String, which will not do "x,y,z='abc'".
      See in the cases.

4. Do Tuples, list, set, I add a new class ContainerLiteral to Literal, and make it work properly.
  1) Tuples, list will be print properly. However, set is not stored as ordered, the order of elements in set may not printed the same.
  2) Tuples, list will do Add properly. Set does not have add operation.
  3) Tuples, list will do Mult properly. Set won't do it neither.
  4) tuples, list, set will do multiassign properly.

This project give me a better understand of the polymorphism and Virtual Function, Virtual base class, Abstract class etc.
